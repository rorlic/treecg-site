Armed with all this new knowledge on LDES you may consider offering one or more data sets as LDES. Alternatively, you may want retrieve one or more existing data sets available as LDES. Where do you start?

The [Flemish Government](https://www.vlaanderen.be/en) has created, as part of the [Flemish Smart Data Space (VSDS)](https://www.vlaanderen.be/vlaamse-smart-data-space-portaal) project, some [technical standards](https://www.vlaanderen.be/vlaamse-smart-data-space-portaal/data-delen/standaarden) and open-source [LDES components](https://www.vlaanderen.be/vlaamse-smart-data-space-portaal/data-delen/bouwblokken), including a lot of [high-level documentation](https://www.vlaanderen.be/vlaamse-smart-data-space-portaal/documentatie), [technical documentation](https://informatievlaanderen.github.io/VSDS-Tech-Docs/), reference implementations of a [LDES Server](https://informatievlaanderen.github.io/VSDS-LDESServer4J/latest/) and a [LDES CLient](https://informatievlaanderen.github.io/VSDS-Linked-Data-Interactions/2.12.0/ldio/ldio-inputs/ldio-ldes-client) (as part of a [linked data pipeline framework](https://informatievlaanderen.github.io/VSDS-Linked-Data-Interactions/latest/)).

In the [technical documentation](https://informatievlaanderen.github.io/VSDS-Tech-Docs/) you can also find a link to a [series of tutorials](https://github.com/Informatievlaanderen/VSDS-Onboarding-Example), which I wrote as part of my [onboarding](https://www.vlaanderen.be/vlaamse-smart-data-space-portaal/onboarding) assignment. The tutorials will help you to get started using the [LDES Server](https://github.com/Informatievlaanderen/VSDS-LDESServer4J) and the [Linked Data Interactions framework](https://github.com/Informatievlaanderen/VSDS-Linked-Data-Interactions) (includes the LDES Client). Both open-source components are available as configurable, ready-to-run [docker](https://www.docker.com/) images on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/). There you can find the [server](https://hub.docker.com/r/ldes/ldes-server) and the [framework](https://hub.docker.com/r/ldes/ldi-orchestrator) docker images.

When creating your linked data solution, you should try to use as many as possible standard data models that are applicable for your domain and region, such as the [OSLO standards](https://data.vlaanderen.be/standaarden/) or the [Smart Data Models](https://github.com/smart-data-models). If no standard is applicable to your situation, you should strive to use existing standard vocabularies when mapping your custom non-linked data model to a linked data model. Online you can find many registries, such as [EU vocabularies](https://op.europa.eu/en/web/eu-vocabularies) and [Linked Open Vocabularies](https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov/vocabs), which should help you get started. Another great website is [prefix.cc](https://prefix.cc/), where you can lookup namespace prefixes.

If you want to learn more on LDES you can also consult the following, which contains a lot of information and additional references:
* An [article by the Spanish Government](https://datos.gob.es/en/blog/overcoming-data-publishing-challenges-linked-data-event-streams-ldes) on how LDES can help you overcome your data publishing challenges.
* An [article by the Semantic Interoperability Centre Europe (SEMIC)](https://interoperable-europe.ec.europa.eu/collection/semic-support-centre/linked-data-event-streams-ldes) on LDES in general.
* This site which contains the [TREE](https://tree.linkeddatafragments.org/) and [LDES](https://tree.linkeddatafragments.org/linked-data-event-streams/) home sites.
